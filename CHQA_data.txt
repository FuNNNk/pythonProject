dear team ,
in <number> , i had an accident on my left eye when a ball smashed it .
retina fallen down , lens damaged . i had not been operated at that point only later , in <number> when the pressure was very high ( above <number> mp ) . this first operation had fixed the retina with endolaser , removed vitreous body filled with silicone oil , replaced the lens with an artificial one and stabilized the pressure to around <number> - <number> mp . however , the eye got blood , retina got detached and it had to be operated again . this time , the oil replaced with gas .
after <number> years , another attempt made with oil and lastly with gas , but the retina fallen again and again .
currently , the retina is still detached , the pressure is low ( max <number> mp ) , has often blood around the iris and it hurts a bit when the air pressure changes . i cannot see anything with it apart from blur lights . the doctor says , this damaged eye is shrinking continuously .
my other eye functioning well . i learned to live together with it , however , the doctor says , he strongly recommends enucleation . i dont know if there is any other option to avoid enucleation .
i have <number> young children so if there were any option to avoid enucleatio , i would happy travel / pay for that .
kindly let me know if there is any other option . my main priority - if available - would be to live with my own or another organic eye which does not look scary even if it is not functional .
second priority is to have usable organic eye - but my doctor told , this is not yet possible . please confirm .
i know you are specialized in

this ever happen ? and if it does , how can a patient detect it ? there are

one answer i have heard put forward is that foreign objects embedded in
tissue become encased in some kind of hard flesh and somehow eliminated
from the body . could this really happen ? is there something i could read
about it ? what about the people who have found foreign objects still
sitting around in their tissues after aeons ?

concussions and long term head trauma from abuse ii
i was a victim from an abusive relationship , both verbal and physical . during this time i received substantial injuries to my head . slight concussions led to full - fledged concussions , losing the ability to talk very well , then think very well , and a subdural hematoma , on the left side , bled down inside my head to behind my left eye , which made it unable to move . along with an intense headache and drinking a lot of coffee , the neurosurgeon did not have to do brain surgery , as my eye finally moved ! battered women ' s told me to get out of the area a stay gone if i wanted to stay alive . so i did ! speech therapy helped considerably , the story goes on . anyway , i hear and read a lot about concussions and head trauma for football players , young and old , and wonder if any studies have ever been done for women ? a few years ago , i had a partial stroke , but enough to set me back a bit . but this time i know what i need to do to help fix my head , again .

hi all ,
i am from india and really worried .
i have a <number> months old baby girl . i have read the article on lactose intolerance . she is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products . when she was a new born , i started giving her lactogen ( a formula milk ) a little bit along with my milk . she was fine with it but after <number> weeks , i switched her to another formula milk named nan pro <number> which is for babies upto <number> year . she started drinking that along with my breast milk . after <number> weeks , she started getting diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least <number> times in one day . therefore , i consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only . i did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore , i gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell . she was file with all the medicines . however , once the medicine stooped , she again started getting diarrhea . this continued on and off .
after a while , the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her zerolac ( soy milk ) along with breast feeding . i did that and everything smoothened . however , after <number> months , i asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as i was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk . the doctor asked me to give her formula milk ( nan pro <number> ) . i did that but just after half an hour , she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach . once that stopped , she started getting diarrhea which continued till <number> days . she was put back on zerolac again and breast milk .
as she is now <number> months old , i thought of giving cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again . i am unable to find the right doctor here in india where i live .
please help my daughter in this situation . please let me know the contact detail may be an email address of any doctor with whom i can discuss my case . please help us .
thanks for all your help .

rehabbing a finger that was splinted
i badlydislocated my finger <number> weeks ago . i reset it myself as it happened late in the evening . i splinted it myself with a store - bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage . i just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today ( yes , i am kicking myself for not going earlier ) . the x - ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat , perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured . ( the bone was ok . i guess we will not know if it was ever broken . ) nonetheless , i have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days . meanwhile , there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board . i am concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect . i certainly know you will not know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but i was curious ( a ) what possibilities i might expect and ( b ) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff . <repeated> should i expect to regain motion . <repeated> can it be rehabbed ? i am assuming so , and if so , how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long ?

article defining ' conversion disorder '
in your article defining ' conversion disorder ' , [ <url> , the quote " conversion disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has blindness paralysis , or other nervous system ( neurologic ) symptoms that cannot be explained be medical evaluation " , seemed to imply that the physical symptoms were valid as proving to be valid , but however the doctor could not ' figure ' out why , . <repeated> but when i went to another source , another article quotes the disorder as a " physical disability that is not caused by any physical impairment " - so i am defining this as symptoms that are visibly correct as analyzed visually but when under examination for deadened nerves or broken bones , no evidence is found ? > that is the definition i am getting from the other source about this disorder . for example , someone claims blindness , as my instructor explained , and when the person claiming blindness is placed near a ledge , does not walk off the ledge . <repeated> since i am assuming also that optical tests of the retina , or pupil proved nothing substantial ?
